Evaluation and analysis of results -- what did you discover?
MovieLens Dataset:- 

We test a bunch of simple baselines such as SVD, Biased-Matrix Factorisation and CCCFNet. For CCCFNet, to simulate 2 independent domains we split the utility matrix of movieLens dataset. The performance of the different methods is compared based on the RMSE values. CCCFNet always beats the simpler baseline methods and hence establishes that it is a better technique by the virtue of using a hybrid Content and CF method.

Yelp Dataset:- 
We evaluated 2 different source domains for one target domain.

1. Source Domain Food
2. Target Domain Restaurant

1. Source Domain Shopping
2. Target Domain Restaurant

The idea was to see if there is a appreciable increase the recommendation performance in one of the configurations. Ideally, the food-restaurant recommendation should perform better than shopping-restaurant since the domains are correlated. 

We measure the recommendation performance using the RMSE.
