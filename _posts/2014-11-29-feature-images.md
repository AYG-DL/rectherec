to this problem of huge data flood.

In general, recommendation systems rely on user modeling approaches to approximate user preferences and build user profiles based on 
users' purchase history, item ratings etc. Collaborative Filtering and Content Based Recommendation are the standard 
techniques of recommendation used in the industry. However, standard recommendation systems suffer from many 
problems:
    * Cold Start Problem - when a new user starts using the system
    * First Rater Problem - when a new item is introduced

**Cross Domain Recommender Systems** are one of the newer techniques
